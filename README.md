#Go Fish

Play the classic card game against an AI. This is an experiment in object orientation in the Javascript
language. This project was before I started using git, so it all got uploaded as a big chunk.

One of the more challenging aspects of this site is all of the asynchronous page loading during each round. I had to insure that the user followed along with the computer's turn well enough that they believed there
is play going on back and forth.
